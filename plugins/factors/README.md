# Factor Plugins

This directory contains factor implementations for StockRadar. The current implementation provides a foundation for factor calculation with performance and C++ translation in mind.

## Current Implementation

- `ma_factor.py`: Moving Average factor with configurable window and price column
- `volume_spike_factor.py`: Volume Spike detection with configurable threshold
- Base class in `core/factor_base.py` with common functionality

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimizations

- **Numpy Vectorization**:
  - Replace pandas rolling operations with pure numpy for better performance
  - Use numba for compute-intensive operations
  - Implement parallel processing for large datasets

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Add streaming calculation support for large datasets
  - Implement memory-mapped file support
  - Add data chunking for very large datasets

### 2. Factor Features

- **Additional Factors**:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Price Momentum
  - Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

- **Factor Combinations**:
  - Add factor composition support
  - Implement factor arithmetic operations
  - Support for complex factor combinations

### 3. C++ Translation

- **Code Structure**:
  - Add C++ header files with equivalent structures
  - Document mapping between Python and C++ types
  - Implement memory layout compatible with C++

- **Optimization Opportunities**:
  - SIMD instructions for vector operations
  - OpenMP for parallel processing
  - GPU acceleration for large datasets

### 4. Testing Improvements

- **Test Coverage**:
  - Add edge case tests
  - Add more performance benchmarks
  - Test with real market data

- **Validation**:
  - Add cross-validation with other libraries
  - Implement statistical validation
  - Add historical backtesting

### 5. Documentation and Usability

- **Documentation**:
  - Add detailed API documentation
  - Include factor calculation formulas
  - Add usage examples and tutorials

- **Configuration**:
  - Add JSON/YAML configuration support
  - Support for factor parameter tuning
  - Add factor versioning

### 6. Production Features

- **Error Handling**:
  - Add detailed error messages
  - Implement graceful degradation
  - Add data quality checks

- **Monitoring**:
  - Add performance metrics
  - Implement logging
  - Add health checks

### 7. Integration

- **Data Sources**:
  - Add real-time calculation support
  - Implement streaming data handling
  - Add multiple data source support

- **Storage**:
  - Add factor data caching
  - Implement efficient storage formats
  - Add versioning support

## Priority Order

1. Additional Factors (RSI, MACD) - Most immediate value
2. Performance Optimizations - Critical for production
3. C++ Translation - Important for HFT scenarios
4. Testing Improvements - Essential for reliability
5. Documentation - Important for maintainability
6. Production Features - Needed for deployment
7. Integration Features - For production scaling

## Contributing

When adding new factors, please ensure:
1. Factor inherits from `FactorBase`
2. Comprehensive tests are included
3. Performance considerations are documented
4. C++ translation path is clear
