# Product Expansion Concepts

## Personal Quant Copilot
- Combine the simulator and factor pipeline to create a weekly “signal diary” that emails summaries for a user’s tracked tickers.
- Ingest brokerage CSV holdings and annotate each position with factor streaks, signal confidence, and suggested actions.

## Vertical Research Workspaces
- Package curated factor libraries for niches (energy transition, semiconductor supply chain) with domain-specific alerts.
- Allow users to clone and customise templates that include vetted data providers, factor presets, and sector KPIs.

## Scenario Sandbox
- Layer historical backtesting and Monte Carlo scenarios on top of the backtester to answer “what if” questions about regime changes or allocation tweaks.
- Provide configurable risk overlays (drawdown limits, tail-risk alerts) and visual comparison dashboards.

## Collaborative Strategy Lab
- Expose REST/WebSocket APIs plus notebook examples so advanced users can prototype factors, register them via the registry, and share within a workspace.
- Track provenance and performance of shared strategies; enable voting/promotion flows for production deployment.
