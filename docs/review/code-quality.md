# Code Quality Findings

## Critical Issues
- `core/runner.py:110` leaves `_fetch_market_data` unimplemented, so the primary pipeline raises `NotImplementedError` before data ingestion.
- `configs/config.yaml:18` references `plugins.factors.ma_factor.MAFactor`, but the actual factor class is `MovingAverageFactor`, causing configuration-driven imports to fail during bootstrap.
- `plugins/strategies/mean_reversion.py:45` and `plugins/strategies/momentum_breakout.py:46` expect factor columns (`ma`, `std`, `resistance`, `support`, `momentum`) that no bundled factor provides, preventing signal generation even with fabricated data.
- `data_storage/version_control.py:82` serializes metadata directly inside filenames via `json.dumps`, introducing characters that are invalid in common filesystems and breaking compatibility across storage backends.
- `jobs/run_weekly_signal.py:10` imports `strategy.signal_generator` and `config.config_loader`, neither of which is present. Scheduled executions abort on import.
- `tests/test_data_storage.py:87` instantiates `DataStorageBase`, an abstract base class, and the same suite depends on live Redis/TimescaleDB instances, so the test run fails in a clean environment.

## High-Risk Concerns
- `core/runner.py:73` attaches new handlers to the global `StockRadar` logger each time a runner is instantiated, resulting in duplicate log lines over successive runs.
- `plugins/strategies/mean_reversion.py:94` and `plugins/strategies/momentum_breakout.py:116` apply `.values` masks, losing index alignment when multiple tickers exist, which silently corrupts signal assignments.
- `data_storage/redis_cache.py:108` and `data_storage/timescaledb_storage.py:111` assume version identifiers are simple strings; the metadata-rich filenames emitted by `VersionControl` violate those assumptions.

## Maintainability Debt
- `strategy_engine/` is scaffolding without concrete implementations, so downstream consumers must reimplement orchestration primitives.
- Several modules (for example `data_fetcher/utils/validators.py`, `strategy_engine/base.py`) are empty placeholders, increasing cognitive load and obscuring true system boundaries.
- Configuration validation exists (`core/config.py`) but the runtime path (`core/runner.py`) ignores it and operates on raw dictionaries, increasing drift risk between spec and execution.
- Tests use randomised data without seeding (`tests/test_data_storage.py:23`), leading to nondeterministic behaviour and making regression analysis harder.
